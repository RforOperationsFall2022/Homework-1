# Homework 1: Building a basic ShinyApp

Due Date: 11/11

Nearly every Shiny application requires you to translate user inputs to allow them to manipulate the data you visualize for them. For this assignment you must use data from an open data website (you may download and clean the data and write it as a CSV).

Data Resources:
* WPRDC: https://data.wprdc.org/
* Data World: https://data.world/datasets/data
* US Open Data: https://www.data.gov/
*	EU Open Data: http://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/
*	Just about any major US City

Directions: 
* Create three (3) different kinds of plots/figures 
* Use DT to create one (1) data table
* Include at least two (2) different types of inputs
* One (1) functioning downloadButton() 
* Inputs must use reactivity in a logical manner with all outputs displayed to users
